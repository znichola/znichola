### Hello

I'm Niki ðŸ‘‹, I'm studying programming at [42Lausanne](https://42lausanne.ch/) and have a passion for it, most especially when it's a group endeavour.

Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of:

## Typescript projects

#### [ft_transcendence](https://github.com/znichola/ft_transcendence)

A single page site for playing multiplayer games of pong, as well as community management, friends, chatrooms and spectator mode. The backend uses [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) for the server, [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as an ORM to communicate between the two. The frontend uses [React](https://react.dev/) for the user interface [Reactrouter](https://reactrouter.com/) to get SPA client side routing, with [TanStack Query v4](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) for state management. The styling was done using the [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) design system.

## C++ projects

#### [WebServ](https://github.com/BPhilagor/WebServ)

A http server that support POST, GET and DELETE, cookies and session management, and a configurable CGI, examples provided in php, python and bash. The server uses the `kqueue` api for request multiplexing, the GCI execution is also added to the queue for a seamless no hang experience with multiple concurrent requests.

## C projects

#### [MiniRT](https://github.com/znichola/miniRT)

A 3D ray-tracing rendering engine built from the ground up using the  [minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) for a basic X-Window api. It supports basic primitives, Plane, Sphere, Cone, and Cylinder, as well as texture mapping images or a configurable checkerboard pattern. The engine also supports the [Phong reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model) model with shadows from multiple light sources and correct color mixing. Particular attention was given the optimization, mainly for the development experience, debugging the maths function for the various shapes was non trivial. Multithreading was implemented with `pthreads` api and thought was given to the data-structures used.

#### [Minishell](https://github.com/sophiakoulen/minishell)

A simplified shell, imitating the behavior of bash, in/out files, pipes, wildcards and control flow with && || ( ). Also includes a unittest framework written in bash, implemented to ensure correctness during development.

#### [Fract-ol](https://github.com/znichola/fract-ol)

Mandelbrot, Julia and Burning Julia fractal rendering, written in `C` using a basic graphics library the [minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux). The complex number maths was custom implemented along with panning an zooming.

## GameJams

I love the fast paced goal oriented format of the GameJam/Hackathon, the team dynamics and the mission to compleat a project. For all of my submissions I took the role of programmer and used [GoDot](https://godotengine.org/), chosen for it's excellent documentation and solid browser performance, and used it's GDScript, a python like language for development.

#### [GitWars](https://0xonyx.itch.io/gitwars)

Event: [UPsi Jam 2.0](https://itch.io/jam/upsi-jam-2-0) A physics based game with falling balls and mechanics in place to direct them to your opponent for them to deal with.
